# RadixSortDNA
A Radix sort function that sorts the A,C,G and T characters from DNA strings
The following code was written for a practical for the Algorithm & Data Structures unit in Monash University.

generateKmers.py:
•Accepts a parameter k strictly in the range [16,32];
•reads in a ‘longstring.txt’ as input, containing a long string of DNA, consisting of A,C,G and T characters;
•generates k-mers by sliding across this long source string left to right, using a sliding window of size k (moving the window one position on the source string at a time);
•converts each k-mer into an unique integer in a base-4 number system. We will refer to these integers (corresponding to k-mers) as the ‘integer encoded k-mers’;
•writes to the ﬁle ‘kmers.txt’ the following information (three columns per-row): the k-mer strings (ﬁrst column), their corresponding integer encodings (second column), their corresponding oﬀset/position in the source string (third column).

radixLSD.py:
•reads the output ﬁle (‘kmers.txt’) generated by the above program; 
• implements the LSD radix sort illustrated in the background; 
• sorts using the LSD radix sort implementation the contents in kmers.txt, using the integer-encodings (second column of that ﬁle) as the key;
• writes the sorted output into ‘kmers sorted.txt’ (same format as the input ﬁle).
